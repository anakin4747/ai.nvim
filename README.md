AI chatbot tool written in vimscript with test driven development

# How it works

First a GET request at /copilot_internal/v2/token:

Then we get json in return

So to test you should write the json out to a file so that it can be easily
switched out


writing to the chat buffer is how you will send. this allows you to decouple
the ai adapter by making the ai adapter act on autocmds when the request get
written to the buffer. So the UI main has to focus on getting the text from the
user into the buffer and the LLM just needs to read the chat from the file.

add tests for other modifiers like botright, topleft, etc

I was not able to catch this error with a test:
```
Error detected while processing function ai#main[17]..<SNR>61_open_chat:
line    6:
E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
```

I have resolved it with a `slient!` before `edit`

bug for a range with a single line not working

So you will need to have a locking mechanism so that you do not edit the
buffer will its doing its handshake, or you can have a way so that it will
always just append the most recent file.
